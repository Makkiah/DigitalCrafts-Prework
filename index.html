                What Goals do I Hope to Achieve? </br>
                My main goal is to just finish what I've started with the things I want to create & learn. </br>
                I've wanted to learn how to build websites and apps since I was a kid, but I never seen it through.
                I grow tired of thinking <i> How would my life be if I finished learning the things I'm most interested in?</i> </br>
                As far as projects go, I want to build a gaming website that could help gamers everywhere get more games to play at competative prices. <br>
                Everyday I practice patients with meditaion. This is, by far, one of the best habbits I could recomend If you want to
                add structure and clarity to your life. I hope you are being patient with yourself and giving your brain the time it needs
                to commit the knowledge for you to become better. </br>
